## Welcome to my page

I appreciate you taking the time to visit by blog. Writing this chronicle has been a long term goal of mine. Through these article I wish to share my knowledge of bioinformatics and its resources. Having worked in acedemics and the biopharma industry I have seen bioinformatics transition from simple adhoc scripts to complete CICD pipelines for production and therapetutic process.
